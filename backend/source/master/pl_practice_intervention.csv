<p>Implement agroforestry, cover cropping, polyculture, hedgerows, livestock integration, energy efficiency, and renewable energy as part of regenerative agriculture and decarbonization strategies to increase resilience and farmer income.</p>","<h3>1. Enabling Conditions for Agroforestry in a Procurement Organization:</h3>
<p><b>Sustainable Sourcing Policies:</b>  Development of procurement policies that promote the inclusion of agroforestry products and support suppliers engaging in agroforestry practices.</p>
<p><b>Educational Initiatives:</b>  Implementation of educational programs for procurement professionals to enhance their understanding of agroforestry benefits and promote the inclusion of agroforestry in sourcing strategies.</p>
<p><b>Supplier Collaboration:</b>  Collaboration with suppliers committed to agroforestry, fostering partnerships and encouraging the adoption of agroforestry practices within the supply chain.</p>
<p><b>Certification Standards:</b>  Utilization or establishment of certification standards that recognize and verify agroforestry practices, ensuring authenticity and compliance in the procurement process.</p>
<p><b>Long-Term Contracts:</b>  Consideration of long-term contracts with suppliers practicing agroforestry to promote stability and incentivize continued commitment to sustainable practices.</p>
<h3>2. Enabling Conditions for Agroforestry on a Farm Level:</h3>
<p><b>Land-Use Planning:</b>  Development of comprehensive land-use plans that integrate agroforestry components, considering the placement of trees and shrubs within the overall farming system.</p>
<p><b>Technical Support:</b>  Access to technical support and extension services to assist farmers in implementing agroforestry practices, optimizing tree-crop interactions, and addressing challenges.</p>
<p><b>Financial Incentives:</b>  Provision of financial incentives or favorable payment terms for farmers adopting agroforestry, supporting their financial viability during the transition.</p>
<p><b>Access to Tree Species:</b>  Availability of diverse and appropriate tree species for agroforestry, enabling farmers to select trees that complement their specific crops and enhance overall farm productivity.</p>
<p><b>Community Engagement:</b>  Engagement with local communities and agricultural extension services to raise awareness of agroforestry benefits, build support, and encourage the adoption of these practices.</p>
<p>For both procurement organizations and farms, successful implementation of agroforestry requires a commitment to sustainable practices, collaborative relationships, ongoing education, and the integration of agroforestry principles into the core of farming and procurement strategies.</p>","<p><b>Agroecological Practices are most likely to emerge as an action for implementation if you have identified the following strategic choices:</b>  Regenerative Agriculture, Smallholder Crop Production, Decarbonisation Levers, Selecting a Sustainability Certification, Precision Agriculture, or Supplier Capability Building.</p>
<h3>Implementation of agroecological practices can bring the following benefits:</h3>
<p>•	Improve farmer gross margin and income through the avoidance of expensive synthetic agrochemical inputs like fertilisers and pesticides</p>
<p>•	Help enhance yields over the long term through improving the soil and local ecosystem health</p>
<p>•	Improve carbon sequestration on farms. If appropriately set up, monitored, measured and accounted, this could contribute to business carbon reduction commitments. If certified, it could also create a secondary income stream through farmers selling carbon credits.</p>
<p>Implementing this requires a long-term commitment to upskilling and capability building either with direct suppliers to cascade up the supply chain or, if pursuing Direct Farmer Contracting, direct with farmers. The resource requirements for this training and capability building must be clarified with suppliers as part of the Cost of Goods model, developed as part of the procurement strategy.</p>
<p>Additionally, if there is an income gap during the transition to new practices, the procurement strategy should identify partners or financial mechanisms, such as blended finance, that can bridge this gap, and ensure these are reflected in the Cost of Goods cost model.</p>","<h3>Environmental Perspective:</h3>
<p><b>Soil Health:</b>  A mix of trees, cover crops, hedgerows, diverse crops, and livestock manure builds soil organic matter, reduces erosion, improves water infiltration, and strengthens microbial activity.</p>

<p>Successful implementation of carbon sequestration requires a commitment to sustainable practices, collaborative relationships, ongoing education, and the integration of climate-friendly principles into the core of farming and procurement strategies.</p>","<p>When is this a strategic choice?</p>
<p>Implement decarbonisation levers where net-zero or climate mitigation is a corporate goal or where external risk assessments highlight climate threats to supply security.</p>
<h3>What it means:</h3>
<h3>Decarbonisation levers are activities that a business can use to reduce carbon emissions. They can be performed directly by the business or, as is more likely in this instance, in the upstream supply chain. Examples of decarbonisation levers can include:</h3>
<p>•	Switching to renewable energy</p>
<p>•	Improving energy efficiency of equipment and processes</p>
<p>•	Agroforestry or soil conservation</p>
<p>•	Carbon sequestration</p>
<p>Some decarbonisation levers are about directly reducing emissions produced e.g. switching to renewable energy. Others are opportunities to capture carbon, offsetting emissions that may occur elsewhere.</p>
<p>When offsetting activities are done within your own value chain, it is referred to as insetting. The whole value chain can present opportunities for insetting and materials sourced from agriculture can offer brilliant opportunities. For example, agroforestry, increasing natural habitats for biodiversity or increasing soil organic matter.</p>
<p>There are challenges associated with insetting. There are physical challenges in ensuring the permanence of actions taken to inset carbon. There are also accountancy challenges in calculating the carbon benefit achieved through these actions. Both of these require specialist input to ensure they are done properly.</p>
<p>Insetting can also benefit farmer income. Insetting actions that produce carbon credits that a farmer can sell is a way of generating additional income. This can be particularly valuable if farmers can use marginal land for actions such as tree planting.</p>
<p>Ensuring carbon insetting requires commitment and verification over the long term. A business must be confident that this can be achieved in order to make this a valid strategic choice.</p>","<p>Environmental Perspective</p>
<p>Practices such as agroforestry, cover cropping, reduced tillage, and improved manure management increase soil organic carbon and strengthen biodiversity. Shifts to energy efficient machinery, irrigation, and cold storage cut fuel use, while on farm renewables reduce reliance on fossil energy. Together, these actions lower emissions, improve soil and water health, and build resilient ecosystems.</p>
<p>Income Perspective</p>
<p>Improved efficiency lowers spending on fuel, fertilizer, and electricity. Renewable energy systems, such as solar for pumping or drying, reduce long term operating costs and can provide surplus energy for sale. Participation in carbon markets can generate additional income through verified credits, and sourcing programs that reward decarbonisation can deliver access to premiums or long term contracts.</p>
<p>Risk Perspective</p>
<p>Decarbonisation reduces exposure to energy price volatility, fertilizer shortages, and regulatory pressures on emissions. Practices that build soil carbon and improve efficiency also strengthen resilience to drought, flooding, and extreme weather. By diversifying income through carbon credits or renewable energy sales, farmers reduce dependence on a single revenue stream.</p>
<p>Link to Procurement Organizations</p>
<p>Procurement partners must be committed to very long-term physical carbon insetting to create value for farmers for low carbon products, co-investing in renewable installations, and supporting measurement and verification of carbon outcomes. Long term offtake agreements, technical support, and access to finance help farmers adopt practices and technologies that deliver both emissions reduction and supply chain resilience.</p>","<h3>1.

<p>By focusing on these targeted pproaches, procurement organizations can enhance the effectiveness of their EIAs, leading to more sustainable and environmentally conscious sourcing practices.</p>","<p>Conducting a value chain risk assessment enables identification and assessment of the sustainability risks in your value chain. This is key to enabling effective risk management in procurement decisions. To do this effectively, it is helpful to have a good level of Value Chain Visibility first. However, a high-level assessment can still bring value to the business by identifying the most likely and severe types of risks associated with different categories.</p>
<h3>The lenses through which you may want to consider a risk assessment include:</h3>
<p><b>•	Country of Origin:</b>  The country defines the macro risks based on its environmental, social, political and economic situation.</p>
<p><b>•	Commodity/category/product of interest:</b>  The processes involved in the production of different commodities, categories and products impact the risks associated with them</p>
<p><b>•	Risks to Assess:</b>  The most important risks to assess may be associated with the countries and commodities of interest, or they may come from reviewing your business strategy and sustainability commitments. The risks of interests may include:</p>
<p><b>o	Environmental:</b>  Climate, Deforestation, Water, Nature</p>
<p><b>o	Social:</b>  Human Rights (inc. Child Labour, Forced Labour, Indigenous Rights), Living Wages and Income, Gender Equality, Health and Safety</p>
<p>If you have engaged with your suppliers as part of improving Value Chain Visibility and have a sense of whether supply chains are likely to be stable or unstable over the next five years, consider potential changes that could occur and, if possible, incorporate this flexibility into the risk assessment approach.</p>

10,Fair Pricing and Flexible Payment Terms,"<h4>Definition</h4>
<p>Use fair pricing, milestone payments, partial prepayments, or shorter payment cycles to support direct farmer contracting, supplier capability building, and other strategic relationship models.</p>","<p>To effectively implement Fair Pricing Negotiation Practices, a procurement organization should conduct thorough market research, maintain transparent cost structures, establish fair and ethical sourcing policies, provide negotiation skills training, utilize data analytics for price trends, implement Supplier Relationship Management practices, ensure legal and regulatory compliance, encourage cross-functional collaboration, define clear contractual terms, establish performance metrics and monitoring mechanisms, and promote supplier diversity and inclusion, fostering a transparent, ethical, and collaborative approach to pricing negotiations.</p>","<p>Being cognisant of cash flows and investment needs of upstream supply chain actors may require implementation of fair pricing and flexible payment terms. Implementing such practices may be particularly important where, as a buyer, you have identified strategic priorities and risks to be managed that must be done by upstream actors and need resource from your business to enable initial investments and actions to be made.</p>
<p>As a buyer, you must understand the cash flow of upstream supply chain actors and how implementing new sustainable practices might impact this. To ensure these actors have the capability to implement these initiatives, the buyer may need to consider different approaches to financing to ensure upstream actors have healthy cash flows.</p>
<p>Similarly, even if not asking upstream suppliers to implement new practices, as a buyer you should be conscious of whether your current payment terms are inhibiting healthy cash flow for upstream suppliers. This could be creating risk in itself by limiting supplier and farmer ability to implement their own improvements.</p>","<p>Income Perspective</p>
<p>Fair, transparent pricing linked to quality and sustainability premia lifts farm income and rewards good practice. Shorter payment periods and milestone or partial payments smooth cash flow, improve planning, and reduce reliance on expensive credit. Pre finance for inputs enables timely purchase of seed, fertilizer, and services, supporting higher yields and more reliable revenue.</p>

<p>•	Do they know where farm-level production is happening and the characteristics of this farming e.g. small holder, plantation, commercial farming?</p>
<p>•	Does the supplier know whether and how their value chain is likely to evolve in the next five years? This can help surface whether the supply chain is stable or unstable.</p>
<p>Why are these questions relevant?</p>
<p>•	The country of production and farm characteristics will impact the probability and severity of environmental and social risks</p>
<p>•	Understanding whether and how a supply chain is expected to evolve in the next five years helps to surface whether there is instability in either the supply chain or the supplier’s approach to it.</p>
<p>•	If a supplier has blind spots about their supply chain, this flags the possibility of material sustainability risks within their supply chain. The supplier may lack the capability or inclination to understand their own supply chain and take action to identify and mitigate risks within it. If the supplier lacks this ability, it will be harder for actors further down the value chain, e.g. manufacturers and retailers, to understand and mitigate their own risks.</p>
