        The IDC tool allows companies to make data driven strategic decisions to
        close the income gap for the farmer households in their supply chain,
        through the following steps and analyses:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Measure the (Living)income gap for each farmer segment, based on the
            current household (HH) income data.
          </li>
          <li>
            Identify the most impactful income drivers (and value ranges) that
            can contribute to bridge the income gap, through Sensitivity
            analysis.
          </li>
          <li>
            Analyse the impact of other diversified income sources on HH income.
          </li>
          <li>
            Model different scenarios of interventions to close the income gap.

        A user needs the following input data, to use the tool:
        <ul>
          <li>Primary commodity and country of interest.</li>
          <li>Farmer segments.</li>
          <li>
            • Aggregate data per farmer segment for the five income drivers:
            Land size, Volume, Price, Cost of production (all, for the primary
            commodity) and other on-farm and off-farm Diversified income values
            (for the farmer household).

        Companies that need guidance on collecting the required input data, can

        data collection process, by building custom surveys, based on primary
        commodity, availability of secondary data and availability of resources
        for a lean / detailed data collection. The income data output from the
        IMG tool can directly be applied into the IDC tool for analyses. The
        tool is now available for 6 key commodities namely, Coffee, Cocoa,
        Cotton, Tea, Spices and Palm.
