    description:
      "The lack of accessible, high-quality data leads to suboptimal policies and interventions. Without reliable evidence, mistakes are repeated, intervention designs rely on unverified assumptions, and resources are allocated inefficiently. This not only reduces impact but also creates reputational risks when expected improvements fail to materialize.",

      "The development of CHIS was led and funded by WCF with co-funding from the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) and in collaboration with the German Development Cooperation (GIZ) and the Swiss Platform for Sustainable Cocoa (SWISSCO).
